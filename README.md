# CMS_Blog

This is a blog based website where users can submit entries and notes. This site uses basic HTML for web design and Javascript for coding; The site also uses handlebars to generate then place each blog entry submitted. As I've never used handlebars (and sadly still don't have thge besat grasp on), I was unable to get it operational. I would love to fully implement handlebars and get the site working; I also created a second (incomplete) page for creating posts and will, in the future, try to make it a pop-up form and fully functional.

# How to use the project

Open the webpage from the index file and click "add blog" to be taken to a separate page. then type in a title and the content (note: the code is incomplete so clicking add does nothing)

# Credits

While I was the sole person working most of these assignments, I usually received help from classmates, instructors, and online tutorials for help better understanding certain concepts
